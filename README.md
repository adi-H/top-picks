# Toppicks

a goodreads-esque social platform, but for skincare products!



## FAQ

#### 'a goodreads-esque platform'? what does that even mean?

have you ever needed a new cleanser, say, and didn't know where to start?
if you're a skincare-newbie and are just realizing what words mean what
that could be a really daunting task!

each company promotes their own products, and influencers promote what
they believe in or are paid to believe in, and online / in-person 
shops promote what they have in stock-- it could get really confusing really fast!

toppicks allows you to see all the skincare products in the market, sorted by 
skintype, concern, and brand, regardless of where you can or can't buy them. it allows
you to see all the options you could possibly pick!

#### your color scheme is really pretty  

thank u ‚ù§
